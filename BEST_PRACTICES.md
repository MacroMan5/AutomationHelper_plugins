# Best Practices - How to Use This Plugin Effectively

‚ö†Ô∏è **This plugin has limitations.** Follow these practices to get the best results.

## The #1 Rule: Section Your Workflows

### ‚ùå What NOT to Do

**Don't paste huge workflows:**
```
You: "Fix this workflow [pastes 3000 lines of JSON]"

Result:
- Context overflow
- AI gets confused
- Misses important details
- Poor quality output
```

**Don't expect miracles:**
```
You: "Debug my entire complex workflow and fix everything"

Result:
- Too broad, unfocused
- Can't understand the full context
- May fix one thing, break another
```

### ‚úÖ What TO Do

**Section your workflow into logical parts:**

```
You: "I have a SharePoint flow with 3 sections:
     1. Get items and filter (lines 50-150)
     2. Loop and process (lines 151-300) ‚Üê THIS IS FAILING
     3. Send notifications (lines 301-400)

     I'm getting 429 errors in section 2. Here's that section:
     [paste 150 lines of the loop section]

     It should filter CNESST items and extract dates."

Result:
‚úÖ Focused analysis
‚úÖ Better understanding
‚úÖ Accurate fix
```

## Size Limits - Keep It Manageable

### Recommended Sizes

| What You're Debugging | Max Lines | Why |
|----------------------|-----------|-----|
| Single action error | 50-100 | Simple, focused |
| Loop/condition section | 150-200 | One logical unit |
| Multiple related actions | 200-300 | Connected operations |
| Full workflow | ‚ùå Don't | Too much context |

### How to Section a Large Flow

**Example: 1000-line workflow**

Instead of pasting everything, break it down:

```
Your workflow structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Trigger (lines 1-50)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Initialize variables (lines 51-100)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Get SharePoint items (lines 101-200)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Filter and loop ‚Üê ERROR HERE (lines 201-500)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Process each item (lines 501-800)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Send notifications (lines 801-1000)
```

**Debugging approach:**

1. **First request:** "I have an error in the filter/loop section (lines 201-500). Here's that part: [paste lines 201-500]"

2. **If needed:** "Now the loop works, but processing fails. Here's the process section: [paste lines 501-800]"

3. **Finally:** "Validate the whole flow structure" - now paste the full JSON

## Provide Context, Not Just JSON

### ‚ùå Bad Request

```
You: [pastes 200 lines of JSON]
```

**Why it's bad:**
- No context about what it should do
- No info about the error
- AI has to guess your intent

### ‚úÖ Good Request

```
You: "I have a Power Automate flow that monitors SharePoint for new files.
     When a file is added, it should:
     1. Check if filename contains 'CNESST'
     2. Extract the date from filename
     3. Store in a variable

     It's failing at step 2 with this error:
     'Cannot access property Nom on primitive value'

     Here's the relevant section (the filter and loop):
     [paste 150 lines]

     The variable ListeDesDossier contains filenames like:
     ['CNESST 2025-01-15', 'INVALIDIT√â 2025-02-20']"

Result:
‚úÖ AI understands the goal
‚úÖ Knows the data structure
‚úÖ Has the error context
‚úÖ Can provide accurate fix
```

## Be Specific About What You Need

### ‚ùå Vague Requests

```
‚ùå "Optimize this"
‚ùå "Fix errors"
‚ùå "Make it better"
‚ùå "Debug this workflow"
```

### ‚úÖ Specific Requests

```
‚úÖ "Reduce API calls in this loop section"
‚úÖ "Fix the 429 throttling error in SharePoint calls"
‚úÖ "Add error handling to this HTTP action"
‚úÖ "Debug why items('Loop')?['Nom'] returns null"
```

## One Problem at a Time

### ‚ùå Multiple Issues at Once

```
You: "This flow has:
     - 429 throttling errors
     - Wrong date format
     - Missing error handling
     - Performance issues
     - Validation problems

     Fix all of these [pastes 1000 lines]"

Result: Overwhelmed, poor results
```

### ‚úÖ Sequential Problem Solving

```
Session 1:
You: "Fix the 429 throttling error in this loop [paste 100 lines]"
‚úÖ Gets fixed

Session 2:
You: "Now fix the date format in this section [paste 80 lines]"
‚úÖ Gets fixed

Session 3:
You: "Add error handling to these actions [paste 150 lines]"
‚úÖ Gets fixed
```

## Understand the Documentation Limits

### What's Well Documented

‚úÖ **Power Automate:**
- Forms (100%)
- Excel (100%)
- Outlook (100%)
- Teams (100%)
- Built-in actions (100%)

‚úÖ **n8n:**
- Core nodes (basic)
- AI nodes (basic)

### What's NOT Well Documented

‚ö†Ô∏è **Power Automate:**
- SharePoint (20% - basic only)
- OneDrive (20% - basic only)

‚ùå **Not documented:**
- Make/Integromat
- Zapier
- Advanced n8n nodes

**What this means:**
- For well-documented connectors ‚Üí Good results
- For poorly documented ‚Üí Limited help
- For undocumented ‚Üí Won't work well

## Realistic Expectations

### What This Plugin CAN Do

‚úÖ Debug common errors (401, 403, 429)
‚úÖ Suggest fixes based on documentation
‚úÖ Generate basic workflow JSON
‚úÖ Refactor simple sections for performance
‚úÖ Validate syntax and basic best practices

### What This Plugin CANNOT Do

‚ùå Understand your entire business logic
‚ùå Fix complex multi-step workflows in one go
‚ùå Work miracles with 3000-line JSONs
‚ùå Debug undocumented connectors perfectly
‚ùå Read your mind about what data structure you're using

## Example: Good Workflow

### Scenario: Complex SharePoint Flow with Multiple Issues

**‚ùå Bad Approach:**
```
1. Paste entire 2000-line workflow
2. Say "fix everything"
3. Get confused output
4. Nothing works
```

**‚úÖ Good Approach:**

**Request 1 - Throttling:**
```
You: "I'm getting 429 errors in this SharePoint loop.
     Here's the loop section (lines 200-350):
     [paste loop section]

     It processes about 500 items."

Result: Adds concurrency limits and delays
```

**Request 2 - Data Structure:**
```
You: "Now I'm getting 'Cannot access property' error.
     Here's the filter and loop (lines 200-450):
     [paste section]

     The filter shows: contains(item(), 'CNESST')
     But loop tries: items('Loop')?['Nom']

     Variable is array of strings like:
     ['CNESST 2025-01', 'INVALIDIT√â 2025-02']"

Result: Fixes property access on string primitives
```

**Request 3 - Error Handling:**
```
You: "Add error handling to this HTTP section:
     [paste 150 lines]

     If HTTP fails, I want to log and continue."

Result: Adds Scope with error handler
```

**Request 4 - Validation:**
```
You: "Validate the complete flow structure now"
     [paste full workflow - now it's context-aware from previous fixes]

Result: Final validation and polish
```

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Use Clear Action Names

‚ùå `Compose`, `Compose_2`, `Compose_3`
‚úÖ `Extract_Date_From_Filename`, `Validate_CNESST_Format`

**Why:** Clear names help AI understand your intent

### 2. Explain Your Data

‚ùå "This variable contains items"
‚úÖ "Variable contains array of strings: ['CNESST 2025-01-15', 'INVALIDIT√â 2025-02-20']"

**Why:** AI needs to know data types to suggest correct fixes

### 3. Include the Error Message

‚ùå "It's not working"
‚úÖ "Error: 'Cannot access property Nom on primitive value of type String'"

**Why:** Exact error messages are crucial for accurate diagnosis

### 4. Mention What Works

‚ùå "Everything is broken"
‚úÖ "The filter works and returns correct items, but the loop assignment fails"

**Why:** Helps isolate the actual problem

### 5. Test Incrementally

After each fix:
1. Test it
2. Confirm it works
3. Move to next issue

Don't pile all fixes without testing.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Kitchen Sink Approach
```
‚ùå Sending entire workflow + all errors + "fix everything"
‚úÖ One section + one specific error + clear context
```

### Mistake 2: No Data Structure Info
```
‚ùå "items('Loop')?['Nom'] returns null, fix it"
‚úÖ "items('Loop')?['Nom'] returns null.
    Loop iterates array from this filter: contains(item(), 'CNESST')
    So it's array of strings, not objects"
```

### Mistake 3: Expecting Perfection
```
‚ùå "Generate a perfect enterprise workflow for [complex requirements]"
‚úÖ "Generate basic structure for SharePoint->Email workflow,
    I'll refine it"
```

### Mistake 4: Not Reading Limitations
```
‚ùå "Debug my Zapier workflow"
‚úÖ Reads README, sees Zapier not supported, uses for PA/n8n instead
```

## Summary

### The Golden Rules

1. **Section your workflows** - max 200-300 lines per request
2. **Provide context** - explain what it should do
3. **Include data structure** - what types are your variables?
4. **One problem at a time** - don't pile issues
5. **Be specific** - "fix 429 error" not "fix everything"
6. **Test incrementally** - verify each fix before moving on
7. **Read the docs** - know what's supported
8. **Realistic expectations** - it's alpha, it has limits

### Remember

üéØ **This is an AI assistant, not a magic wand**

It works best when:
- You give it manageable chunks
- You provide clear context
- You have realistic expectations
- You test and iterate

It works poorly when:
- You dump 3000 lines of JSON
- You expect it to understand everything
- You don't provide context
- You're using unsupported platforms
