## Documentation Format

All new documentation follows the **Agent-Optimized Format** specified in `.claude/output-style/docs-optimized-format.md`:

### Key Features:
1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Structured metadata for filtering
   ```yaml
   type: connector-overview
   connector_name: Microsoft Forms
   keywords: [forms, survey, response]
   api_limits:
     calls_per_minute: 5
     calls_per_hour: 300
   ```

2. **XML-Tagged Sections**: Precise extraction
   ```xml
   <official_docs>URL</official_docs>
   <description>...</description>
   <api_limits>...</api_limits>
   <critical_limitations>...</critical_limitations>
   ```

3. **Unique IDs**: Direct linking and reference
   ```xml
   <limitation id="lim-001" severity="critical">
   <action id="action-002" category="read" complexity="low">
   <error id="err-429" http_code="429">
   ```

4. **Semantic Keywords**: Context for search relevance
   - Severity levels: critical, high, medium, low
   - Complexity ratings: low, medium, high
   - Categories: create, read, update, delete, search, utility
